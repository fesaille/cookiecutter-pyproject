# Contributing

## Submitting changes

A [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) is a clear list of what
you've done:

- please follow our coding conventions (below);
- make sure all of your commits are
  [atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit) (one feature per
  commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine
for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```bash
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
